# bitshower - a cool Python (3) animation that might look strangely familiar...

Licensing
---------

The main program (bitshower.py) is under the MIT license, which is stored in the LICENSE file. I got console_size.py from a Stack Overflow answer, which is attributed above the code. That file is under the CC BY-SA 2.5 license (linked to above the code).

Usage
-----

1. Set your terminal colour to green on black and make it full screen (if you're not on Windows..)
2. Run it, sit back, put some dubstep on, and hack away!
